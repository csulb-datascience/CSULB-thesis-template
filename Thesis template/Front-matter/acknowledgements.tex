The acknowledgments page is not required, but many people include one. You may give appreciation to anyone who has assisted you with writing or researching your manuscript as well as friends and family or anyone who has inspired you or supported you during your life or the course of your education.

If you wish to dedicate your manuscript to someone, you can write out a dedication as part of your acknowledgments, but a separate dedication page is not allowed. All of the formatting rules that apply to your text apply to the acknowledgments page.

Sentences or paragraphs in languages other than English can be used in the acknowledgments without quotation marks or italics or translation. Slang and colloquialisms can be used, but keep in mind that your manuscript will be accessible online to future employers and others assessing your background who may be find such language unprofessional.

If you have received funding for your research and the funding organization requires recognition, mention it on the acknowledgments page.
